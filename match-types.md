Bug Squash
----------

The first commit adds code but also includes one (or more?) bugs in that code.  The next player to commit must fix at least one existing but, then add new code which contains one (or more?) bugs that can be fixed by the next player.

Issues can be created by players to indicate they have located a bug and that they are working on fixing it.  Once a fix has been committed, that issue should be closed.  Issues should not be created for bugs that aren't going to be fixed so that the next player will have a chance to find that bug on their own.
